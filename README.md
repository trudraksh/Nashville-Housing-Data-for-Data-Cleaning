# Nashville-Housing-Data-for-Data-Cleaning

This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing the data in the "Nashville_Housing" table within the "Project" database. The primary goal is to enhance data quality by addressing issues such as date format standardization, populating missing property addresses, breaking down addresses into individual columns, splitting owner addresses, converting 'Y' and 'N' values in the "SoldAsVacant" field to 'YES' and 'NO', and removing duplicate records.
